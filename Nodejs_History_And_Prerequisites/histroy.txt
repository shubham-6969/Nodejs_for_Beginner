Here's a clear explanation of **Node.js History** and its **Prerequisites**—ideal for learning, interviews, or notes.

## 📜 Node.js History

### 🧑‍💻 Creator:

* **Ryan Dahl** created Node.js in **2009**.

### 🎯 Why Node.js was created?

* Traditional web servers (like Apache) were **synchronous** and **multi-threaded**.
* Ryan wanted a **non-blocking**, **event-driven**, and **lightweight** runtime to handle **high concurrency** efficiently.

### 🛠️ Built on:

* **JavaScript Engine:** Google’s **V8 Engine** (same as in Chrome).
* **Language Support:** JavaScript (server-side).
* **C/C++ bindings:** For system-level operations (I/O, networking, etc.).

### 📅 Key Milestones:

* **2009**: First release (v0.1.0).
* **2010**: NPM (Node Package Manager) launched.
* **2015**: Node.js merged with io.js (a fork), forming a unified community.
* **LTS** (Long-Term Support) versions are released regularly.
